## Feature: Specification for a Third-Party Document Viewer that Supports Audio and Images
This specification outlines the requirements for a document viewer system that can collect documents from various third-party sources and display their content in both visual and audio formats. The system must be highly configurable, allowing users to fine-tune its settings and improve the quality of the results displayed on its interface.
